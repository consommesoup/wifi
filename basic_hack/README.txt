this app is just to play arround with friend not for malicious use.
the .exe files where made with pyinstaller and for some reasons 
dont work as good as the .py file.

the app basically copies it self to windows atartup folder,
"C:\\Users\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup"

as the softwares here are run on the startup of the pc
so the app is executed and asks for email and password if not given
then the pc restarts else they are mailed to person whose 
email and pass is given in the app

to get the email from the app 
write your email in the py code and your pass in the py code
